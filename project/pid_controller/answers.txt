// Answer the following questions:

// Add the plots to your report and explain them (describe what you see)
See screenshot folder.

Error Steering is like the complement of Steering Output, and helps to balance this Ouput. It is good when these values are approximately proportional to each other. Otherwise, the car is behavioring unexpectedly.

There is a huge between the Error Throttle and Throttle Ouput curves. 

// What is the effect of the PID according to the plots, how each part of the PID affects the control command?


// How would you design a way to automatically tune the PID parameters?
Algorithms, like the demo in Udacity, are required . Then, the implementations of these algorithms must be evaluated and improved in real-time through a connection to a simulation like Carla.

// PID controller is a model free controller, i.e. it does not use a model of the car. Could you explain the pros and cons of this type of controller?
It can be used for any model of car. However, it is not optimized for a very specific design, and may lead to hidden issues later on.

// (Optional) What would you do to improve the PID controller?
