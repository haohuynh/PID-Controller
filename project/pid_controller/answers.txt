// Answer the following questions:

// Add the plots to your report and explain them (describe what you see)
See screenshot.


// What is the effect of the PID according to the plots, how each part of the PID affects the control command?


// How would you design a way to automatically tune the PID parameters?
Algorithms, like the demos in Udacity, are required . Then, these algorithms must be connected to a simulation like Carla for a real-time evaluation and improvement.

// PID controller is a model free controller, i.e. it does not use a model of the car. Could you explain the pros and cons of this type of controller?
It can be used for any model of car. However, it is not optimized for a very specific design, and may lead to hidden issues later on.

// (Optional) What would you do to improve the PID controller?
